2. Grant of License

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, CKSource hereby grants You, in one of the License Models described 
in Section 4, a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, worldwide license ("License") to use, 
reproduce, modify, and distribute a Software Release in a collective work assembled with the Product.

You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using, installing, copying, or distributing 
the Software. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by CKSource, your use, installation, copying, or distribution 
of the Software indicates your acceptance of this License.

3. Scope of License

All rights of any kind to the Software, which are not expressly granted in this Agreement, are entirely 
and exclusively reserved to and by CKSource. The Software is protected by applicable national and international 
laws and treaties.

You may use, install, copy, and distribute the Software solely as provided in this Agreement. You may not rent, 
lease, loan, sublicense, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the 
Software, in whole or in part, nor permit anyone else to do so.

It is agreed that in exchange for the license set forth herein, you will pay a license fee ("License Fee"). 
The fee value will be specified by CKSource at the moment of the purchase.

4. License Models

The Software may be assembled with the Product and redistributed in respect of one, and only one, of the 
following models ("License Models") of Your choice:

a) ("Basic") Assembling the Software into a Product distributed as a single website ("Site"). The Site URL ("URL") 
   must be specified at the moment of purchase. The license will not be valid for sub-domains of the specified URL.
   This license includes 2 Developer licenses that cover Development Activities exclusively related to the Site.

b) ("Professional") Assembling the Software with a maximum of 3 websites ("Professional Sites") owned or produced by You. 
   Sites produced by third-parties with Software produced by You are not included in this License Model.
   This license includes 5 Developer licenses that cover Development Activities exclusively related to Professional Sites.

c) ("Developer") License granting Development Activities to a single Developer Person.

A valid Developer license is required for every single Developer Person. Developer licenses cannot be shared among 
different Developer Persons. Non-Development Activities on Production Websites do not require Developer licenses.

License Fee values may differ depending on the license model.

5. Unlicensed Copies

If You did not pay License Fee, You may use unlicensed copies of CKFinder for the exclusive purpose of demonstration.
In this case You will be using CKFinder in "demo mode". Without derogating from the forgoing, You may not use 
CKFinder in  "demo mode" for commercial purposes. CKFinder shall only be used for evaluation purposes and may not be
used or disclosed for any other purposes, including, without limitation, for external distribution. You may not remove 
the demo notices from the interface nor disable the ability to display such notices or otherwise modify CKFinder. 
Product support, if any, is not offered for CKFinder in "demo mode".

6. Agreement Acceptance

This Agreement is automatically accepted by both parties as long as You are in possession of legal evidence 
("Legal Evidence")  that the acceptance has taken place. The Legal Evidence can be represented by (i) a copy 
of this Agreement signed by You and CKSource or (ii) a valid Certificate of License Ownership, provided by 
CKSource and addressed to You. The Legal Evidence must precisely indicate this Agreement Name, the Software Name, 
the License Model You have chosen, and the following restrictive information, if applicable:

a) If You have chosen the Basic License Model, the Site Hostname must be indicated in the Legal Evidence. This Agreement 
   will be valid for the Software assembled with the Site publicized under the Site Hostname only. Other Sites are
   excluded from this Agreement as long as a Legal Evidence is not produced for each of these Sites.

Legal Evidences for different combinations of License Models, Sites, and Products will not restrict each other 
and will not interfere in the rights granted to You by each of them.

Legal Evidences are not transferable to different Sites and Products.

7. Limitation on Releases

This agreement is valid for all Releases of the Software with Release Dates within or before the 365 days that 
follow the Effective Date ("Upgrade Period"). CKSource has no obligation to provide you any Release that is not 
released for general distribution to other CKSource licensees. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to 
obligate CKSource to provide additional Releases to You under any circumstances.

8. Support

CKSource shall provide support for Developers covered by valid Developer licenses for the period of 365 days 
following the Effective Date ("Support Period"). Support shall be limited to electronic messaging access. 
CKSource shall keep You informed, either per CKSource readiness or by following your request, including changes 
to it, about the rules and procedures that You must perform to enjoy support under the terms of this Agreement. 
Support topics shall be limited to the following (each a "Support Request"):

a) problem solving,
b) bug reporting,
c) and documentation clarification.

The number of Support Requests that CKSource is entitled to accept from You is limited to 2 per month if You have 
chosen the Basic license model, or 5 per month if You have chosen the Professional license model. 
CKSource may refuse Support Requests that exceed these limits.

CKSource is not in any way obliged to perform bug fixing or custom development activities as a result 
of a Support Request.

9. License Key

Following a valid License purchase, a unique license key (the "License Key") may be provided to You, which allows 
Software activation. The License Key is subject to the restrictions set forth in this License and may not be disclosed 
or distributed in any way. The disclosure or distribution of the License Key shall constitute a breach of this License, 
the effect of which shall be the automatic termination and revocation of any and all rights granted herein.

10. Source Code

The original source code ("Source Code") of the Software may be distributed by CKSource alongside its executable 
version, or as an integral part of it. You may modify and compile the Source Code. The Source Code or its modified 
version can be copied and distributed exclusively within the scope of this license, as defined in the "License Model" 
terms of this license, as long as a valid license has been purchased for the distribution target. CKSource retains all 
rights over the Source Code and all its modified versions. Redistributions of the Source Code and modified versions of it 
must contain the original headers and copyright notices. Modifications to the Source Code must be explicitly and entirely 
identified in the Source Code files. This section of the license supersedes all modification restrictions imposed by 
other sections. You are not allowed to remove copyright notices nor make changes to the license validation code present 
in the Source Code.

11. License Fee

In consideration for the License granted in this Agreement during the term of this Agreement, You agreed to 
pay to CKSource a one time fee ("License Fee").

In consideration for the Software upgrades access and support services provided during the Upgrade Period 
and Support Period, You shall pay a yearly fee ("Annual Support and Upgrade Fee").

The License Fee and the Annual Support and Upgrade Fee amount shall be specified by CKSource at the moment 
of the purchase as a single unified price.

The fees listed in this Agreement do not include taxes. If CKSource is required to pay any sales, use, property, 
excise, value added, gross receipts, withholding or other taxes levied on the Software or support under this 
Agreement or on Your use thereof, then such taxes shall be billed to and paid by You. This Section does not apply 
to taxes based on CKSource net income, franchise taxes or CKSource's employer contributions and taxes.

You understand that CKSource uses third-party paying agents to process selected payments. You understand that 
until payments are not received and verified by the paying agent, this Agreement is not valid.

All payments made hereunder are nonrefundable. You may not withhold or set off any amounts due under this Agreement. 
Failure to pay any fee when due shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. In addition, if You fail to 
make any payments when due for support, upon written notice to You, CKSource shall cease providing support.

12. Automatic Renewal

You may opt to automatically extend the expiration date for both the Upgrade Period and Support Period by successive 
cycles of 365 days (each one a "Renewal"). In such case, you agree to pay a fee for each Renewal at the beginning 
of each cycle. The annual Renewal fee shall be informed by CKSource at the moment of the purchase and optionally 
agreed by you.

If you opted to have automatic Renewals, CKSource shall send you a payment request for the Renewal fee at any 
moment following the first day of each Renewal period. You shall perform the full payment in 30 calendar days 
following the payment request.

Both parties can discontinue the automatic Renewals by written notification to the other party before the 
beginning of extension cycles.

13. Reservation of Rights and Ownership

CKSource reserves all rights not expressly granted to You in this Agreement. The Software is protected by 
copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. CKSource owns the title, copyright, and other intellectual 
property rights in the Software. The Software is licensed, not sold. This Agreement does not grant you any rights to 
the Software's trademarks or services.

14. Termination

Without prejudice to any other rights, this Agreement automatically terminates if You fail to comply with the terms 
and conditions of this Agreement. You may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause. In case of termination, 
in any circumstance, payments issued by You will not be reimbursed.

You shall immediately discontinue distribution of Product, assembled with the Software, upon expiration or 
termination of this Agreement.

15. Warranty

CKSource warrants that it has full title and ownership to the Software and has the authority to grant the 
license hereunder. To the best of CKSource's knowledge the Software does not infringe upon the intellectual 
property rights of any third party and that CKSource did not receive any notice regarding any alleged infringement 
thereof.

16. Disclaimer of Warranties

With the exclusion of warranties explicitly mentioned in Section 15, the Software and its related material are 
provided "AS IS" and without warranty of any kind. CKSource expressly disclaims all other warranties, expressed 
or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

17. Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other Damages

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL CKSOURCE BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 
PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS 
OR CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER INFORMATION, FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, FOR PERSONAL INJURY, FOR LOSS OF PRIVACY, FOR FAILURE 
TO MEET ANY DUTY INCLUDING OF GOOD FAITH OR OF REASONABLE CARE, FOR NEGLIGENCE, AND FOR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY OR OTHER 
LOSS WHATSOEVER) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, THE PROVISION 
OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT OR OTHER SERVICES, INFORMATON, SOFTWARE, AND RELATED CONTENT THROUGH THE SOFTWARE 
OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, OR OTHERWISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS 
AGREEMENT, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF THE FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), MISREPRESENTATION, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF 
CONTRACT, AND EVEN IF THE OWNER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

18. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall CKSource's liability exceed the license fee paid, if any.

19. Governing Law and Venue

This Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws of Poland, and You and CKSource further consent to 
exclusive jurisdiction by the courts of Poland.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU
General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers
to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined
below.

An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based
on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided
by the Library.

A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of
the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.

The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding
any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application,
and not on the Linked Version.

The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application,
including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding
the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied
by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

 a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not
    supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
    meaningful, or

 b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.
You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited
to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

 a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its
    use are covered by this License.

 b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification
of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications,
if you also do each of the following:

 a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and
    its use are covered by this License.

 b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

 c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library
    among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

 d) Do one of the following:

   0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code
      in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a
      modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6
      of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

   1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses
      at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly
      with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

 e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under
    section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified
    version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the
    Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source
    and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the
    manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with
other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

 a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

 b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where
    to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from
time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain
numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General
Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for
you to choose that version for the Library.
